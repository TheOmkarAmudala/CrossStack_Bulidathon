NanoPanda introduces a **new category of mobile security** — one that operates *after trust is granted*, not just before access is allowed. While traditional systems stop at unlocking the device, NanoPanda continues to protect users throughout real-world usage scenarios.

### 🔐 Core Capabilities

### 🧠 Continuous Identity Verification
NanoPanda continuously verifies the active user using privacy-preserving facial feature embeddings. This ensures that device usage remains tied to the legitimate owner even after the initial unlock — a critical gap in modern mobile security.

### 🕵️ Trusted Insider Threat Detection
Most digital misuse is not caused by strangers, but by people we trust. NanoPanda detects suspicious usage by individuals who already have physical access to the device, a scenario ignored by passwords, fingerprints, and Face ID.

### 🔒 Privacy-First Facial Recognition
Instead of storing raw images, NanoPanda converts facial data into secure vector embeddings. This approach ensures strong identity verification while respecting user privacy and ethical AI principles.

### 🌊 Calm, Non-Intrusive Security
NanoPanda follows **Calm Technology** principles. Monitoring happens silently in the background, without constant alerts or fear-based interruptions. Users are notified only when meaningful risk is detected.

### 🧾 Evidential Activity Logging
Sensitive application access is logged with identity context, timestamps, repetition patterns, and session metadata — creating a verifiable audit trail without reading or storing user content.

### 🤖 Agentic AI Automation
Using autonomous workflows, NanoPanda analyzes repeated suspicious patterns, correlates historical data, and generates structured security reports without human intervention.

### 😊 Emotion-Aware Safety Layer (FER)
NanoPanda integrates Facial Emotion Recognition to detect high-stress or anxious states during sensitive actions (such as financial transactions), gently prompting users to double-check before proceeding.

### 🎯 Low-Friction, Human-Centered UX
Designed with a minimalist, task-focused interface inspired by leading consumer apps, NanoPanda ensures most user interactions complete within **2–3 intuitive taps**.
